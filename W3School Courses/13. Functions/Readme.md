# Functions
## Predifined functions (int main()) and self defined functions
The most commonly known "int main()" function (the predefined function in C and C++) is used to run the main code in C and C++ (printf() and scanf() are also predefined functions). The user can however define a function themselves and either call (execute) it in the int main() function or in another self defined function.

## Types of functions
In C, a void function is a function that is not required to directly return a value while any other ordinary function such as an integer, float, character, string, and boolean function is expected to directly return a value depending on the data type.

## Function parameters
When additional information is needed in the function, it can be passed on as a **parameter** and the information passed is called an **argument** which will be passed in order and the number of arguments must be the same as the number of parameters.

## Global vs Local scope
When a variable is declared inside a function, it is called a **local scope** meaning it can _only be used within the function is belongs to_. A **global scope** is a variabled _declared outside a function_ with means it can be used _within the entier area_ it belongs to.

## Function declaration vs definition
The difference between a **function declaration** vs a **function definition** is that a function declaration is what determines the function's return type, name, and any parameters needed while the definition means the block of code that the function is required to execute once called.

## Function recursion
The term **function recursion** simply means when a function calls itself which can be useful sometimes to _break complicated problems down into more simple problems_.
