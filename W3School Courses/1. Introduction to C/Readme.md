# Introcution to C
## Standard Input/Output
The <stdio.h> library (abbreviation for Standard Input/Output) is a C library that allows input and output within the console from the user by enabling functions like "printf" and "scanf".

## "main" function
A block of code must be declared inside a main function which in this case can be referred to as an entry point and it is compulsory that
one is run right after the compiled work is executed in the console. The first entry point must be declared as "int main()" and any code
will go in there to execute.
